1. A variable is a definable function that can 
have data stored to it, making it able to be saved 
to the RAM.

2. B and E are illegal because B contains a number
and E contains a special character that isn't 
an alphanumeric character.

3. No they aren't the same because the characters
are case sensitive, making them 2 different 
variables, indispensible from one another.

4. In this scenario, this wouldn't be legal because,
"amount" is not already predefined with a value.

For example, you could say "amount = 4". Later,
you could redefine the variable with "72 = amount",
making the statement legal.


5. This would print "val" because you defined a string
instead of sending the predefined variable.


6.
a) is an integer
b) is a float
c) is a float/integer
d) is an integer
e) is a string

7. Nothing will print because you can't have 2
variables of the same name/alias. However, this statement is only true for JavaScript. On Python however, you can have the variable redefined
simultaneously in order of the definition.

Example:
number = "one"
number = "two"
number = "three"
print(number)
